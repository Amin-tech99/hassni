### 📄 Key Files You Must Include

```

#### 3. `Procfile`  
No extension. Just one line:
```

```

#### 4. `railway.json` *(optional but good for override settings)*  
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "gunicorn app:app"

2. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app).
3. Click **"New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"**.

### ✅ Must-Have Code Inside `app.py`

Make sure this is near the bottom:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=False, host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)))
```

And import `os` at the top:
```python
import os
```
